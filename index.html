				<p> 
 	Maeda&apos;s father, a Japanese immigrant, <q>practiced an extreme form of Shintoism, a philosophy that has shaped Maeda&apos;s own world view.</q><a href="http://www.rimonthly.com/Rhode-Island-Monthly/September-2008/John-Maeda-wants-to-jump-start-your-brain/index.php?cparticle=2&siarticle=1"><sup>2</sup></a> Maeda shares how his father's belief system played a prominent role in his upbringing: <blockquote> Growing up, my siblings and I were taught that everything in our environment, including inanimate objects, had a living spirit that deserved respect&#8230;Under this strict code of life, my taking a clean sheet of paper, crumpling it up, and throwing it away was grounds for punishment. I would be denying the paper&apos;s existence to perform a useful task, and divine retribution would result from the disrespect I had shown the paper. <span class="italic">Aichaku</span> is the Japanese term for the sense of attachment one can feel for an artifact. When written by its two <span class="italic">kanji</span> characters&#8230;the first character means <q>love</q> and the second one means <q>fit.</q> <q>Love&#8211;fit</q> describes a deeper kind of emotional attachment that a person can feel for an object. It is a kind of symbiotic love for an object that deserves affection not for what it does, but for what it is. Acknowledging the existence of <span class="italic">aichaku</span> in our built environment helps us to aspire to design artifacts that people will feel for, care for, and own for a lifetime.<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/laws-simplicity"><sup>3</sup></a></blockquote>
 			</p>
 			<p>
 	One of the artifacts that is central to Maeda &apos;s life is the computer. Much of Maeda&apos;s work is devoted to better understanding the computer. He constantly tries to approach his computer&#8211;related work with fresh eyes. For example, he wants to understand the inherent differences between what digital design is versus print design and make the most of the functions of each.

	Apart from the Shinto belief system, Japanese culture impacted John Maeda&apos;s upbringing in other ways too. Maeda <q>likes to quote from comics, [a] habit that can be traced to his Japanese&#8211;American roots. In Japan, a style of comic book called manga&#8212;usually printed in thick, black&#8211;and&#8211;white books&#8212;is widely read by people of all ages. Maeda&apos;s mother, a third&#8211;generation Japanese&#8211;American born in Hawaii, was exposed to the custom, and she used comic books and word search puzzles to stimulate her children&apos;s interest in reading.</q><a href="http://www.rimonthly.com/Rhode-Island-Monthly/September-2008/John-Maeda-wants-to-jump-start-your-brain/index.php?cparticle=2&siarticle=1"><sup>2</sup></a>
				</p>
				<p>
	Maeda&apos;s Japanese cultural background influence his design sensibilities. When asked in an interview about the difference in American and Japanese aesthetics, Maeda response is acutely observational: <blockquote>I have noticed that many modern, high&#8211;end designers have Japanese&#8211;style houses. The precept here is minimalism. Japan is an island nation and has no resources so it has to be minimal. In the U.S. people want more, more, more. Europe also has a minimalist take, because its resources have been depleted. I really think this is an issue of American style versus non&#8211;American style. American style is based on the fact that this is such a plentiful land. I think these two styles don&apos;t work well together because they are two different types, like a fruit and a vegetable. There are people who are sensitised to both or one or the other.<a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/reputations-john-maeda"><sup>4</sup></a></blockquote>
			</p>
				<p>
	Maeda leans towards the non&#8211;American style. <q>John does not own a necktie. He drapes his whippet&#8211;thin frame in gray or black suits, usually Issey Miyake, calculatedly rumpled, but nicely tailored, high quality and minimal.</q><a href="http://www.rimonthly.com/Rhode-Island-Monthly/September-2008/John-Maeda-wants-to-jump-start-your-brain/index.php?cparticle=2&siarticle=1"><sup>2</sup></a>

In <span class="italic">Maeda&#64;Media</span>, John shares how he was influenced by Paul Rand's work to change the direction of his educational pursuits. He also provides a transcript of a conversation he has with Rand shortly before his death: <blockquote>As a graduate student at M.I.T., I stumbled upon a thin, nondescript book called <span class="italic">Thoughts on Design</span> by Paul Rand. At the time I was trying to build a reputation for myself as a graphical user interface designer. But as I flipped through Rand&apos;s book, I was humbled by the power with which he manipulated space and the clarity of his prose. I was immediately inspired to pursue the field of graphic design, not necessarily pertaining to the computer.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was fitting that eight years later, I would return to M.I.T. as a professor of design, and that I would host a lecture by Paul Rand at M.I.T. The time for the lecture was set at ten in the morning. An early lecture in American universities is rare because students usually study late into the night and are less apt to attend early events. But Rand insisted that he speak in the morning. He said, <q>If someone isn&apos;t willing to wake up to hear me to speak, I don&apos;t want to speak to them!</q>
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditorium was packed beyond capacity with people from all over New England, some waking up as early as five in the morning to arrive in time for the lecture. The Director of the Media Lab, Nicholas Negroponte, later remarked that during his career at M.I.T. he had never seen such an overwhelming audience for a morning lecture. Although the lecture hall was crowded, complete silence reigned as everyone&apos;s attention was completely focused on Rand.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night before the lecture we had dinner together. Afterwards he asked me, <q>So, what are we going to talk about tomorrow?</q> My immediate reply was, <q>We?</q> He said, <q>Yes, it&apos;s boring if I just get up there and talk. So let&apos;s have a conversation first.</q> Following Rand&apos;s request, I began with some very basic questions.</blockquote>
				</p>
		<blockquote>					
		<div id="one">
			Rand:
		</div>
		<div id="onea">
I&apos;ve waited eighty&#8211;two years to come to this place. I knew Gyorgy Kepes and Muriel Cooper, but they never invited me. I&apos;m wondering why Mr. Maeda invited me at this late date, but I&apos;ll do my best.
		</div>
		
		<div id="two">
			Maeda:
		</div>
		<div id="twoa">
			What is design?
		</div>
		
		<div id="three">
			Rand:
		</div>
		<div id="threea">
			Design is the method of putting form and content together. Design, just as art, has multiple definitions, there is no single definition. Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that&apos;s why it is so complicated.
		</div>
		<div id="four">
			Maeda:
		</div> 
		<div id="foura">
			What is the difference between a designer and an artist?
		</div>
		<div id="five">
			Rand:
		</div>
		<div id="fivea">
			There is no difference between a designer and an artist. They both work with form and content. I try to create art, whether I make it or not is not up to me, it&apos;s up to God.
		</div>
		<div id="six">
			Maeda:
		</div>
		<div id="sixa">
			What is the difference between good design and bad design?
		</div>
		<div id="seven">
			Rand:
		</div>
		<div id="sevena">
			A bad design is irrelevant. It is superficial, pretentious&#8230;basically like all the stuff you see out there today.
		</div>
		<div id="eight">
			Maeda:
		</div>
		<div id="eighta">
			What are the fundamental skills of a designer?
		</div>
		<div id="nine">
			Rand:
		</div>
		<div id="ninea">
			The fundamental skill is talent. Talent is a rare commodity. It&apos;s all intuition. And you can&apos;t teach intuition.
		</div>
		<div id="ten">
			Maeda:
		</div>
		<div id="tena">
			Most of your designs have lasted for several decades. What would you say is your secret?
		</div>
		<div id="eleven">
			Rand:
		</div>
		<div id="elevena">
			Keeping it simple. Being honest, I mean, completely objective about your work. Working very hard at it.
		</div>
		<div id="twelve">
			Maeda:
		</div>
		<div id="twelvea">
			How did you get started as a young designer?
		</div>
		<div id="thirteen">
			Rand:
		</div>
		<div id="thirteena">
			I think you should ask instead, <q>How did I get started as a baby?</q>
		</div>
After his lecture, Rand offered autograph copies of his books and there was a line that did not clear up until an hour later. I tried to shuttle him off to a private reception but he refused to leave until all the people in line were signed and served.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His lecture was so well received at M.I.T. that Dean William Mitchell and Negroponte suggested that Rand join the faculty at the Media Lab and we immediately began the process of appointing him. Negroponte wanted me to confirm Rand&apos;s interest in joining the Lab, after which we faxed Rand explaining the situation. He replied, <q>Of course I accept the position.</q> A few days later he passed away.<a href="http://www.maedastudio.com/matm/"><sup>5</sup></a>

Maeda feels fortunate for the mentors he has had. Shortly after the death of Ikko Tanaka, whom Maeda refers to as one of the greatest design educators he has known, he wrote an article where he mentioned the influence of people on his life:<blockquote>
Tanaka and Rand shared the same quality of honor and dignity that made it seem a noble pursuit to be a designer. I feel fortunate for knowing both Mr. Tanaka and Mr. Rand. The impact of such inspiration transcends good teaching, quality curriculum, or entire schools for that matter because they provide us with the core motivation to seek higher ideals in daily life.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest form of education, whatever field it may be design, education, economics, science or what not, occurs when you have the fortune of meeting great people. Period. You will find great people by being earnest in your work, humble in attitude, and doing your best in all situations. You will find great people by taking the inspiration you have received from others, and unselfishly generating new inspirations to add to the pool of common knowledge. But most importantly, you will find great people by believing that there can be greatness somewhere in the world.<a href="http://www.maedastudio.com/2002/ikko/index.php"><sup>6</sup></a></blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>
	Maeda continues to seek out great people in all his pursuits and draws inspiration from people like Steve Jobs, Barack Obama  (who took the seat of president of the United States the same year as Maeda began at RISD) , to Mark Parker the CEO of Nike, Gordon Mackenzie of Hallmark and Jeremy Lin who is a true team player. Maeda admires designers like Karim Rashid, Bruce Mau and Alan Fletcher of Pentagram. He cites early European modernists like Marcel Duchamp and Gyorgy Kepes as inspiration for his work. Maeda has aptly place himself within a widespread community of creatives and leaders and, most importantly, people who he can learn from.

	The craft Maeda learned at the tofu store translated directly to his use of the computer. <q>There was no software. So you had to type in the programs and run them.  Computer programming was like a real craft back then, and my father, my world at the tofu factory was about making things with your hands, so I began to make things with my mind.</q><a href="http://www.nea.gov/av/avCMS/Maeda-podcast-transcript.html"><sup>1</sup></a><q>The first program he wrote was an accounting one for the tofu store.</q><a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/reputations-john-maeda"><sup>4</sup></a> Maeda recalls <q>I had a dot&#8211;matrix printer but didn&apos;t like the way the default text looked, so I wrote a program to make it print better&#8211;looking text. This was in 1979.</q><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/04/style/04iht-design7.1.5567585.html?_r=0"><sup>7</sup></a>

As an undergraduate student at MIT, Maeda&apos;s <q>first major piece of software was a direct copy of then&#8211;Aldus PageMaker.</q> Maeda recalls <q>I made a desktop publishing system way back when, and that was, kind of, my first step into figuring out how to&#8212;oh, these two sides are kind of fun to mix.</q><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/john_maeda_on_design.html"><sup>8</sup></a>

	With his wife, Kris Maeda, John ran the print and digital design consultancy MAEDASTUDIO based in Lexington, Massachusetts. Maeda shares how his wife pushes him to try something new: <q>My works keeps changing. I&apos;ve been lucky because as soon as I develop a certain style, my wife will say: <q>Oh, you&apos;re doing the same thing over and over again. That looks pretty silly now, doesn&apos;t it?</q> It&apos;s a challenge, because I can&apos;t rely on one trick. People can rely on one trick if they are using a computer because the trick is so instantaneous. Once you make that trick, you just press a button and it happens again. It can ruin your brain. I like to think about making the trick. then discarding it and starting over again. I might be influenced by it, but not be stuck in that same mode. It&apos;s a goal.</q> <a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/reputations-john-maeda"><sup>4</sup></a>

	Maeda describes the niche he carved out for himself at MIT: <q>I discovered that I could draw and program, which was an anomaly  &#8230; Macintosh is taking off, graphical computers emerging.  Remember it was all like text/graphics on the screen?  And everyone needed people who could draw pictures on the computer screen; icons.</q><a href="http://www.nea.gov/av/avCMS/Maeda-podcast-transcript.html" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a>
				</p>
				<p>
	<q>After freshman year at MIT, Maeda landed a summer job working for Tandy computers in Fort Worth, Texas, where he worked on an alpha version of Microsoft&apos;s Windows, designing an alarm clock that Windows users could set to remind them of future events. The next summer he also spent in Fort Worth, this time working for </br>Texas Instruments, handling some complex assignments until his boss figured out he was not an MIT graduate but just a sophomore, and his workload suddenly became less complex.</q><a href="http://www.rimonthly.com/Rhode-Island-Monthly/September-2008/John-Maeda-wants-to-jump-start-your-brain/index.php?cparticle=2&siarticle=1" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a> 
				</p>
				<p>
		Maeda completed his BS and MS in electrical engineering and computer science, respectively. His courses included Artificial Intelligence, Computer Architecture, Analog and Digital Circuitry Design, Semiconductor Modeling, Signals and Systems. Maeda <q>dropped out in the middle of the doctoral programme at the Media Lab and went to Japan, where he completed his doctoral studies in graphic design at Tsukuba University&apos;s Institute of Art and Design.</q><a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/reputations-john-maeda" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a>
				</p>
				<p>
		Maeda followed his future wife, Kris, an engineer, to Japan and pursued a PhD in design sciences at the University of Tsukuba between 1990&#8211;1996 near Tokyo, Japan. His courses include: Product Planning, Product Design, Advanced Typography, Advanced Editorial Design, Sculpture, Plastic Arts and Drawing.
				</p>
				<p>
	In 1996, Maeda returned to the United States and to MIT. Maeda says <blockquote>I actually never wanted to come back to the Media Lab. I was a drop&#8211;out, I had a bad experience here. The lab was never about art or design, it was always about technology. What brought me back was Professor Whitman Richards. He became head of the Media </br>Lab after Muriel Cooper passed away and he realised that the design segment was important to the laboratory. His vision was to make MIT a quality place devoted to issues of the humanities. I found that vision resonated with my goals. It seemed like the right thing for me.<a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/reputations-john-maeda" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a></blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>
	For the next 12 years Maeda taught at MIT and achieved the rank of Full Professor with tenure as a pioneer in the field of advanced user interface and experience design. He led research and sponsor relations at the MIT Media Laboratory.
				</p>
				<p>	
			In an interview with AIGA, Maeda shares <q>I came back to the Media Lab &#8230; to fill the shoes of the late Muriel Cooper. After 11 years, the shoes still feel quite loose, as Muriel had spent decades going after many <q>grails</q> of visual design. My interests have always been very broad. I like creating in all kinds of media, especially words like I write now.</q><a href="http://www.aiga.org/out-of-the-lab-an-interview-with-john-maeda/" target="_blank"><sup>9</sup></a>

			<h2>
			<span class="capital">personality</span> characteristics that contribute to Maeda&apos;s achievements
			</h2>
			</div>
				<p>
In <span class="italic">The Laws of Simplicity</span>, Maeda says <q>In the martial art of Karate, the symbol of pride for a black belt is to wear it long enough such that the die fades to white as to symbolize returning to the beginner state.</q> The idea of trying something and becoming and expert at it, only to return to a beginner&apos;s state seems to be the motto that Maeda lives by. For example, after completing his BS and MS at MIT he returns to being a novice in an entirely new environment, art school in Japan. Also, after earning a tenured professorship at MIT, Maeda jumps at the opportunity to become president of RISD. He dives headfirst into a position that he has little to no training or experience in. He saw a challenge ahead and went for it. Maeda is constanly learning and willing to change and improve. He is not afraid of sharing his thoughts and ideas. He does not just learn through formal education, but through experiences. He intentionally puts himself in positions where he is the novice, where he is vulnerable in order to learn.	
				</p>
				<p>
	Maeda&apos;s willingness and ability to face challenges head&#8211;on and pick himself up from failure without hesitation seem to be the result of his life experiences. The stories he shares depict him as a fast learner. He talks about how he had an inflated ego about his own ability to blend design and technology through computer graphics that popped once he stumbled across Paul Rand&apos;s work. He does not make the same mistake &#8211; thinking too much of himself &#8211; again. His humility comes across clearly, perhaps the most when he expresses appreciation of his mentors and mentions the successes of his students as their own, in some cases despite his input.
				</p>
				<p>
	Maeda is relateable. He connects with people on emotionally by sharing stories. He shares stories from ones about his parents and working at his family business as a child to describing the day he spent working with Paul Rand to his experience opening his new iphone. His stories are often humorous. He uses the stories to connect parts of his life and explain the choices he has made along the way. Maeda is a speaker that captures my attention but does not seem polished. His conversation is peppered with <q>you knows,</q> <q>ands</q> and <q>like</q> that make him feel relatable despite his success.
				</p>
				<p>
	Maeda is intent on not putting himself in a box or becoming too attached to any title. At 47 years of age, Maeda is an accomplished creative, designer, coder, engineer, artist, humanist technologist, leader, professor and the list goes on. Maeda does not want to be limited or defined by what or who he is; he seems to be in constant flux. That is why he is constantly seeking new branches to climb out on. I would not say that he is jumping from career to career, but rather that he is adding on layers. Each of his choices are influenced by his experiences and the advice of people in his life.

		Maeda&apos;s worked at his family&#8211;run tofu business, Star Tofu, as a child. <q>My family would work there every weekend and all vacations. It is a very laborious work. You wake up at 1am and work to 6pm continuously. After school we would work in the store that sold the tofu. My father believed it was unprofitable to have workers, so we were the workers.</q><a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/reputations-john-maeda" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a>
				</p>	
				<p>	
Maeda explains in detail how his father made quality tofu throught troubleshooting: <blockquote>My dad was kind of like MacGyver, really: he would invent, like, ways to make things heavy&#8230;he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu, because tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing, and so you have to have heavy stuff to push out the liquid and make it hard. Tofu comes out in these big batches, and my father would sort of cut them by hand.<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/john_maeda_on_design.html"target="_blank"><sup>8</sup></a></blockquote>

				<p>	
		<blockquote>My father believed in the quality of work as something vital to his being&#8212;as trained to be someone who makes things exquisitely well. So if he needed to sustain the quality of his product, tofu, at an absurdly high level, he would select the best soybean seeds and the best natural ni&#8211;gari that he could procure. And of course, he&apos;d progressively reduce his margins in the process.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother didn&apos;t have a business background as well, and yet somehow their little business survived many ups and downs. And their overall <q>business</q> goal could be achieved &#8212; which was to send me and my siblings all off to college so that we might not have to make tofu for a living.<a href="http://creativeleadership.com/2012/01/28/moms-magic/"target="_blank"><sup>10</sup></a></blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>
Maeda learned the value of hardwork, discipline and humility from working at the tofu store with his parents. Maeda saw school as a refuge from the tofu factory. <q><q>Going to school was like ten times better, and the teacher doesn&apos;t yell at you,</q> Maeda recalls. <q>I loved being at school. I excelled at it.</q></q><a href="http://www.rimonthly.com/Rhode-Island-Monthly/September-2008/John-Maeda-wants-to-jump-start-your-brain/index.php?cparticle=2&siarticle=1"target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a>
				</p>

				Maeda fulfilled his parents dream by gaining admission to MIT. Maeda&apos;s parents: <blockquote>were immigrants, and they thought this thing called a college would save their kids from having to work so hard; so they knew that there were two colleges in the world; MIT and Harvard and had this dream that one of [them] would go to this place, wherever it might be.  [They] were in Seattle, Washington, and they thought MIT might be in Washington as well, even though M stands for Massachusetts.  [They] had no idea, but they had this dream that someday one of the kids could go to college; that was the dream.<a href="http://www.nea.gov/av/avCMS/Maeda-podcast-transcript.html"target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a></blockquote>
				</p>
	 			<p>
	Maeda sees his success as the fulfillment of the American dream.  Maeda grew up in an ethnic enclave, Chinatown, in Seattle, Washington in the late 60s and 70s. His Japanese American dream was only possible because advances made in civil rights before and during his lifetime. Just three years before Maeda&apos;s birth, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his <span class="italic">I have a dream</span> speech and when Maeda was two years old, MLK was assassinated. At this point in U.S. history, minorities, both black and Asian, did not have equal access or equal rights. There are some key points in Japanese American history that are relevant. The first legal Japanese arrived in Hawaii as laborers in 1843. A little less than a century later the Supreme Court reiterated their denial of Japanese residents the right to become citizens because they were not white. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 in 1942 that authorized the forced incarceration of 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry from Hawaii, North and South America. The war ended in 1944 after the nuclear bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was not until 1945 that the last U.S. concentration camp closed. The McCarran&#8211;Walter Act of 1952 granted Asian residents the right to become naturalized U.S. citizens. In 1988, the U.S. government apologized for the mass imprisonment of Japanese Americans during WWII and found that Roosevelt&apos;s Executive Order 9066 was not justified by military necessity and that the decision was based on race prejudice, war hysteria and the failure of political leadership.

So I went to art school and changed my life.<a href="http://www.nea.gov/av/avCMS/Maeda-podcast-transcript.html"><sup>1</sup></a> 
				</blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>
Maeda was fortunate to be receiving guidance from a mentor with years of teaching experience and as diverse a skillset as Cooper: <blockquote>Muriel Cooper was an acclaimed graphic designer before she entered the digital world&#8230;she originally joined M.I.T. as a designer after graduating from the Massachusetts College of Art in 1951. Some of the books she designed for the M.I.T. Press &#8212; like Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour&apos;s 1972 <span class="italic">Learning From Las Vegas</span>&#8212;are on every design buff&apos;s must&#8211;have list. Cooper discovered computers accidentally, during a 1967 M.I.T. summer course taught by Negroponte. She left flummoxed&#8212;the coded data flashing up on the screen <q>didn&apos;t make any goddamned sense to me,</q> as she put it&#8212;but convinced that technology had huge </br>creative potential.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven years later, she co&#8211;founded the Visible Language Workshop with Ron MacNeil to encourage M.I.T. students to use graphic design techniques to translate computer data into more user&#8211;friendly text and images. Technically, Cooper never got around to figuring out how computers actually work and relied on MacNeil&apos;s expertise&#8230;Throughout the &apos;70s and &apos;80s, when computer technology was advancing so rapidly that software designers had to write&#8211;and then rewrite&#8211;their own design rules, Cooper&apos;s derring&#8211;do was an inspiration to students like Strausfeld and John Maeda, the famed digital designer who eventually succeeded her at M.I.T.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/style/tmagazine/07rawsthorn.html?_r=0"target="_blank"><sup>11</sup></a></blockquote>
			</p>
				<p class="indent">
			<q>Many of today&apos;s most gifted software designers were among her students. By encouraging them through her teaching to make the images on a computer screen as clear and appealing as the best&#8211;designed printed graphics, she helped to make our lives easier and more enjoyable.</q><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/style/tmagazine/07rawsthorn.html?_r=0"target="_blank"><sup>11</sup></a>

	Negroponte and Muriel Cooper (1925&#8211;1944)  worked together at the MIT Media Lab and together <q>predicted the evolution of digital interfaces that would allow typography to transform its size, shape and color. Cooper went on to develop the idea of the three&#8211;dimensional <q>information landscape,</q> a model that breaks throughout the window frames that dominate electronic interfaces.</q><a href="https://www.typotheque.com/articles/fluid_mechanics_typographic_design_now"target="_blank"><sup>12</sup></a>   	
				</p>
				<p>
	When Maeda studied at MIT, he was at the core of an intellectual hub of innovation at a time when computer technology was new and full of potential. The MIT Media Lab was founded by Jerome Weisner and Nicholas Negroponte in 1980. 
				</p>
				<p>
Nicholas Negroponte  (1943&#8211;)  was the director of MIT&apos;s Media Lab while Maeda was associate director. Negroponte was interested in art and math and was pushed to study architecture by his father to blend the two. Negroponte eventually realized that working with computers more aptly blended his two interests than architecture. Negroponte is considered a pioneer in the field of computer&#8211;aided design: <blockquote> Negroponte was perhaps best known for founding and directing MIT&apos;s Media Lab, which helped drive the multimedia revolution&#8230;An original investor in WIRED, for five years he penned a column exploring the frontiers of technology&#8212;ideas that he expanded into his 1995 best&#8211;selling book Being Digital. An angel investor extraordinaire, he&apos;s funded more than 40 startups, and served on the boards of companies such as Motorola and Ambient Devices.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his latest effort, the One Laptop per Child project, may prove his most ambitious. The organization is manufacturing the XO  (the <q>$100 laptop</q>) , a wireless Internet&#8211;enabled, pedal&#8211;powered computer costing roughly $100. Negroponte hopes to put millions of these devices in the hands of the children in the developing world by 2010. Most recently, OLPC has managed to put an XO laptop in the hands of every schoolkid in Uruguay.<a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/nicholas_negroponte.html"target="_blank"><sup>13</sup></a></blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>
Weisner  (1915&#8211;1994) was a Michigan native trained in mathematics and electrical engineering. <q>Early in his career&#8230;Wiesner advocated and assisted in developing weapons systems. At the end of World War II, after doing work on radar at M.I.T., he went to Los Alamos to develop electronic components that were used in the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946.</q><a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V114/N51/wiesner.51n.html"target="_blank"><sup>14</sup></a> Weisner regretted his participation in The Manhattan Project that developed the nuclear bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during WWII. He devoted much of his career to speaking out against the nuclear arms race as a science advisor during the Kennedy era:<blockquote>His many activities in the Kennedy era included much preliminary work on the treaty to ban all but underground nuclear tests that was signed in 1963 by the United States, the Soviet Union and Britain. Shortly after President Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963, Dr. Wiesner wrote that the treaty <q>can inspire us to persist in the efforts to avoid the nuclear holocaust that so haunted him.</q> After his Washington service, Dr. Wiesner became dean of the School of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where his career of teaching, research and administration began in 1942. He became provost, the university&apos;s senior academic officer, in 1966 before beginning his nine years as its 13th president.</q> Even <q>after retirement, Dr. Wiesner remained an outspoken critic of the nuclear arms race</q>.<a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V114/N51/wiesner.51n.html"target="_blank"><sup>14</sup></a></blockquote>

		As a newly appointed MIT professor in 1996, Maeda created a transformative course that brought attention to the students' work at MIT: <blockquote>Course MAS964 &#8212; Fundamentals of Computational Visual Form &#8212;formed the initial template for a studio art course in computer science. With an aesthetic reductiveness and a technical rigor almost unseen since the Weimar Bauhaus, Maeda&apos;s class addressed the ways in which computation could intersect with the most elementary concepts of abstract form, color, movement, and interaction. The students&apos; weekly Java assignments were instantaneously posted to the nascent World Wide Web, and, as there was nothing else like it online at the time, the world quickly took notice. Tom White&apos;s ColorCube, Reed Kram&apos;s Kite and Circle, Matt Gorbet&apos;s Balance: the purity and insight of these simple experiments from MAS964 contrasted so starkly with the ham&#8211;fisted aesthetics of the prevailing CD&#8211;ROM multimedia that, outside MIT, designers and artists on at least three continents tuned in to the weekly updates, writing emails and arguing amongst each other as to which student had produced the best results.<a href="http://www.flong.com/texts/essays/essay_creative_code/"target="_blank"><sup>16</sup></a></blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>
	An overview of the MIT Media Lab will further shed light on Maeda&apos;s experience as professor and associate director: <blockquote>When the MIT Media Lab first opened its doors in 1985, it combined a vision of a digital future with a new style of creative invention. It pioneered open computer gardens, personal computing on every desk, and a multimedia network to every room–a radically new set up for the time. It brought together researchers from far&#8211;ranging fields who were passionate about creative expression, with pioneers in the emerging field of digital technology. Emphasis was less on current market needs and more on imagining the future&#8230;the Lab&apos;s motto was <q>demo or die.</q> As early as 1985, the Lab was developing image technology for the <q>home delivery</q> of movies; new approaches to data compression; and Csound, one of the most widely used software synthesis systems. Frequently the Lab developed a concept that was so far ahead of the curve that it took years–sometimes decades–for society to catch up. Early on, for example, Lab founders demonstrated the Aspen Movie Map, a revolutionary hypermedia system that allowed the user to take a virtual tour through Aspen, Colorado–a system that pre&#8211;dated Google Earth by some 25 years. The Lab demonstrated electronic postcards in the mid 1990s, and conducted breakthrough research on personalized news delivery. It was an early developer of wearable computing, pioneered digital tools for constructionist learning, and was experimenting with online sociable media long before there was Facebook or Twitter.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the 1980s, Lab researchers developed the first programmable bricks for LEGO construction kits, as well as research for <q>television of tomorrow,</q> where Lab researchers drove the industry to scalable, extensible, digital generations of television. In 1985, the Lab created the world&apos;s first multi&#8211;color, computer graphic hologram; in 1990, it demonstrated the world&apos;s first real&#8211;time, moving synthetic hologram.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next decade [the 1990s] brought about research breakthroughs in sensors that could detect a user&apos;s actions by measuring the body&apos;s influence on an electric field; software agents with collaborative filtering that help tap into other people&apos;s collective wisdom; systems that allowed 3D interaction with virtual creatures that could <q>see</q> and <q>hear</q>; and NetSound, capable of delivering an entire Beethoven symphony over the Internet in about 10 seconds. It also introduced the world to computers that could recognize and respond to emotion, as well as inexpensive, wireless <q>digital town centers</q> capable of providing even the most remote and underdeveloped areas of the world with digital access.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twenty&#8211;first century brought about even broader&#8211;reaching Media Lab work with a strong emphasis on improving the human experience. The Lab focused on new technologies that seamlessly merge with our bodies to forever change our most basic notion of human capabilities.<a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/files/inventing-future.pdf" target="_blank"><sup>17</sup></a></blockquote>
					</p>
					<p>
	Maeda directed the Aesthetics and Computations Group, <q>an experimental research studio that was founded in 1996. In the short time since its existence, individual experimental work in the ACG has received numerous awards and acclaim for a uniqueness in both concept and craft. A major component of the ACG&apos;s efforts involves outreach to the design and art community in the form of workshop and events that introduce the underlying concepts of computing technology, as exemplified in the <q>design by numbers&apos;</q> project.</q><a href="http://www.designboom.com/eng/interview/maeda.html" target="_blank"><sup>18</sup></a> Maeda transitioned the Aesthetics and Computations Group to the Physical Language Workshop. <blockquote>The Physical Language Workshop  (PLW)  is a research group led by John Maeda and Henry Holtzman from 2003&#8211;2008 at the MIT Media Laboratory. The group designed tools for creating digital content in a networked environment. PLW research includes OPENSTUDIO, an experimental online micro&#8211;economy exploring creativity, collaboration and capitalism, Simplicity, a consortium of students and sponsors investigating innovative approaches towards simplicity in design, and E15, an experimental architecture for designing rich interactions with web content. Our primary impact targets are in the areas of general digital media service architectures, global </br>e&#8211;commerce, distance education, and visual information display systems.<a href="http://plw.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank"><sup>19</sup></a></blockquote> 
					</p>
					<p>
	In an interview in 2007, <q>Maeda says he believes that [technology] has become bogged down by corporate concerns and befuddingly complex, and he has devoted the last few years to trying to address those problems by studying for an MBA and creating a new Physical Language Workshop at MIT to coordinate research into Simplicity, which he sees as essential to the future of business and technology. <q>People are fed up with over&#8211;complication,</q> he said. <q>I can see why the marketing guys want something that does five things not one, but why are cellphones so complicated that you can&apos;t make a call?</q></q><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/04/style/04iht-design7.1.5567585.html?_r=0" target="_blank"><sup>7</sup></a>

Balance is another central them in Maeda&apos;s life and career. He approaches the idea of simplicity in relation to complexity. He sees his parents as balancing each other out. In their family&#8211;run tofu business, Maeda describes his Dad as the service element and his mom as hospitality. Maeda is both an avid author and tweeter. He is able to commit to print words that will be read, reprinted and translated into various languages after writing, editing and designing while simultaneously comfortable publishing 140 character tweets multiple times a day during any spare time. Much of Maeda&apos;s career has been focused on bringing the humanity to technology. This is obvious in one of his early piece&#8212;the human&#8211;powered computer where a group of students pretended to be parts of the computer and performed its functions. Maeda may be a computer genius, but he is also strongly committed to collaborating with others. Maeda also seems to be constantly balancing his family life&#8212;he has a wife and five daughters&#8212;with his demanding career. His family life is private. I could not locate a single picture of Maeda with his entire family. However, what he does as president of RISD is transparent and he makes his thoughts and ideas easily available to everyone via his numerous blogs, talks and tweets.
				</p>
				<p>
				His search for balance is apparent even in his early work. In the nineties Maeda made a series of books <q>called The Reactive Books that demonstrated how you could make the computer respond and behave in fluid, visual ways. This led to the rich vocabulary of Flash as seen today on most websites.</q><a href="http://www.rimonthly.com/Rhode-Island-Monthly/September-2008/John-Maeda-wants-to-jump-start-your-brain/index.php?cparticle=2&siarticle=1" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a>

Maeda describes the work from his 2002&#8211;2003 FOOD exhibit <blockquote>&#8230;9/11 happened, and I was very depressed. I was concerned with contemporary art that was all about&#8230;really sad things, and so I wanted to think about something happy. So I focused on food as my area&#8212;these sort of clementine peel things. In Japan, it&apos;s a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel just in one piece&#8230;It was very good, and I discovered I can make sculptures out of this, actually, in different forms. If you dry them quick, you can make, like, elephants and steers and stuff, and my wife didn&apos;t like these, because they mold, so I had to stop that.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I went back to the computer, and I bought five large fries, and scanned them all. And I was looking for some kind of food theme, and I wrote some software to automatically lay out french&#8211;fry images. And as a child, I&apos;d hear that song, you know, <q>Oh, beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain,</q> so I made this amber waves image. It&apos;s sort of a Midwest cornfield out of french fries. And also, as a child, I was the fattest kid in class, so I used to love Cheetos&#8230;so, I wanted to play with Cheetos in some way. I wasn&apos;t sure where to go with this. I invented Cheeto paint. Cheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with Cheetos. I discovered that Cheetos are good, expressive material. And with these Cheetos, I began to think, <q>What can I make with these Cheetos?</q>
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, I began to crinkle up potato chip flecks, and also pretzels. I was looking for some kind of form, and in the end, I made 100 butter &#8211;fries&#8230;and each butter&#8211;fry is composed of different pieces. People ask me how [I made] the antenna. Sometimes, [you] find a hair in the food. That&apos;s my hair. My hair&apos;s clean &#8212; it&apos;s okay.<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/john_maeda_on_the_simple_life.html" target="_blank"><sup>20</sup></a></blockquote>

			</div>
					<p>
	Maeda was discouraged from pursuing art as a potential career by his parents. There are a couple instances where Maeda&apos;s parents steered him away from art, despite his interest and ability in it. Maeda recalls, <q>In fourth or fifth grade, [Maeda] painted a mural of King Tut for his classroom, and <q>my art teacher went crazy!</q> The teacher even told his parents that their son could be an artist. <q>My parents kind of ignored that,</q></q> says Maeda regretfully.<a href="http://www.rimonthly.com/Rhode-Island-Monthly/September-2008/John-Maeda-wants-to-jump-start-your-brain/index.php?cparticle=2&siarticle=1" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a>
Maeda remembers another poignant example: <blockquote>I think it was in grade school; my parents were there for the parent/teacher conference thing, and my teacher, Mrs. Harita, she told my parents that John&apos;s good at art and math. My father said to his friend the next day: John is good at math. So I learned &#8211; I&apos;m like wait, Dad, what about the art part? And he says John; this art stuff is not good for anything, so the math stuff is good.<a href="http://www.nea.gov/av/avCMS/Maeda-podcast-transcript.html"target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a></blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>	
	 However, the appreciation Maeda received for his work from his grade school teachers had a lasting impact on him. His grade school and junior high teachers praised his art work and made him aware that art was something he could pursue, a path his father temporarily blocked. 
					</p>
					<p>
	Maeda&apos;s father continued to play an influential role in his decisions about college. Maeda explains how his father considered education a necessity in life: <blockquote>My father always encouraged me to take the biggest challenges. When I arrived at MIT, electrical engineering and computer science were known as the hardest majors. I wanted to study architecture, but my father said <q>You won&apos;t be able to feed yourself or your future family. Don&apos;t waste your time.</q> He was a pragmatic man. He grew up poor.<a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/reputations-john-maeda" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a></blockquote>
					</p>
					<p>
	Despite his parent&apos;s discouragement of Maeda pursuing art, both his mother and father affected his design sensibilities early on. When asked what his earliest influences were in an interview, Maeda responded <q>Japanese dishes. My parent&apos;s house was filled with dishes. My mother is a collector of any kind of dish, mainly ceramics and lacquerware. I&apos;d look at these dishes and think they were remarkable.</q><a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/reputations-john-maeda" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a>
					</p>
					<p>
	Maeda describes his father as his first design teacher. <q>Before he was a tofu&#8211;maker, my father was a cook. In Japanese food, it&apos;s not about the flavours, it&apos;s about the presentation, the illusion of being natural. I learned my basic layout sensibilities by helping him lay out food.</q><a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/reputations-john-maeda" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a>

	Maeda went to Japan to pursue art and design. Maeda shares a story about how his experiences with a teacher in Japan directly influenced his career path: <blockquote>I was setting type, the old fashioned way; I was making sculptures out of aluminum, sitting there for a like aluminum is so hard; we think it&apos;s so soft, but it takes forever to mill aluminum by hand. And then I had this teacher in Tsukuba, who pulled me aside and said, so what will you do with your life, John? I said well I want to study the classics and be like you, teacher. He looked at me like I was crazy and he said, <q>You idiot, in Japanese; you horse&apos;s behind</q>; that&apos;s pretty bad in Japanese. He said you&apos;re young, so do something young with yourself. When you get older, the classics will always be there, so don&apos;t worry about it so much. So it was very freeing. So I picked up the computer again; began to make stuff. The stuff was unique because at the time people who could make art and computer program were a rarity and made stuff; people didn&apos;t know what it was. People would stare at it and say that&apos;s not art; that&apos;s nothing; you stop doing that; it&apos;s a disgrace. It was really good; it was good, like oh, you think that, well thank you. Kept on making stuff. It began to become more mainstream. My teachers at the time said to me that I should become a professor, because I should figure out if my work was any good or not.<a href="http://www.nea.gov/av/avCMS/Maeda-podcast-transcript.html"target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a></blockquote>
				</p>

	<q>My teachers in Japan&#8230;told me that if I were to do what I did, I would make a lot of money and be the only one doing it, and that I would never know if I were any good or not. They said: <q>Why don&apos;t you create more people who can do it, and see if you are any good.</q></q><a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/reputations-john-maeda" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a> <q>So at MIT I did that. I came in touch with all these people who could do things like this on the computer, much better than me.</q><a href="http://www.nea.gov/av/avCMS/Maeda-podcast-transcript.html"target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a>

	Maeda describes his own philosophy as a teacher throught the lens of his time at the MIT Media Lab <blockquote>It is based on a simple concept: everyone in my group is independent. I&apos;m independent from them. I just complain once in a while that something isn&apos;t very good. In general, they have their own projects and the credit goes to them, not to me. Generally when art and technology people become professors they want to become more powerful and they will ride their students to greater success. The teachers stop making things and have their students make things for them. So they can make at least one&#8211;and&#8211;a&#8211;half times as many things as they could have made themselves. This causes a culture of disillusionment. After students spend three or four years making things for the <q>boss</q> they don&apos;t want to make anything any more, even for themselves. They forget why they wanted to make things in the first place. I didn&apos;t want my group to be that way.<a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/reputations-john-maeda" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a></blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>
	The sense of community and desire to give back as a teacher and leader that Maeda possesses is something he shares  (or learned from)  his mentors. Maeda&apos;s <q>students have included such gifted software designers as Ben Fry and Casey Reas. Maeda introduced his ideas to a wider audience through books, like 1999&apos;s Design by Numbers, and the following year&apos;s MAEDA@MEDIA, a memoir&#8211;cum&#8211;manifesto for his belief in the creative possibilities of technology. He also wrote software that enabled designers to create fluid, emotionally expressive digital images.</q><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/04/style/04iht-design7.1.5567585.html?_r=0" target="_blank"><sup>7</sup></a>
				</p>
				<p>
		Given his belief that both teachers and students should author and take ownership of their own work, its not surprise that Maeda humbly excuses himself from receiving credit for being an initial driving force for software written by his students: <blockquote>In 2001, when I was a young MIT faculty member overseeing the Media Lab Aesthetics and Computation Group, two students came up with an idea that would become an award&#8211;winning piece of software called Processing&#8212;which I am often credited with having a hand in conceiving. Processing, a programming language and development environment that makes sophisticated animations and other graphical effects accessible to people with relatively little programming experience, is today one of the few open&#8211;source challengers to Flash graphics on the Web. The truth is that I almost stifled the nascent project&apos;s development, because I couldn&apos;t see the need it would fill. Luckily, Ben Fry and Casey Reas absolutely </br>ignored my opinion. And good for them: the teacher, after all, isn&apos;t always right.<a href="http://benfry.com/writing/archives/513" target="_blank"><sup>21</sup></a></blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>
				Ben Fry, one of the creators of Processing, explains Maeda's teaching method that encouraged students to move outside of their comfort zones. In response to the statement above Fry wrote: <blockquote>John&apos;s objection had much to do with the fact that Processing was explicitly an evolutionary, as opposed to revolutionary, step in how coding was done. That&apos;s why it was never the focus of my Masters or Ph.D. work, and instead has nearly always been a side project. And more importantly, for students in his research group, he usually forced us away from whatever came naturally for us. Those of us </br>for whom creating tools was <q>easy,</q> he forced us to make less practical things. For those who were comfortable making art, he steered them toward creating tools. In the end, we all learned more that way.<a href="http://benfry.com/writing/archives/513" target="_blank"><sup>21</sup></a></blockquote>

	While studying in Japan, Maeda became aware of the interconnectedness among the dicsiplines that interested him. This realization was a critical stepping point in his life, because all of his work since has been at the congruence of disciplines. Maeda describes the University of Tsukuba as follows: <blockquote>very Bauhaus&#8212;ish&#8230;I just kept reading. They had a large English language library. So Bauhaus, old art history, going back way back. I was like wow, there has always been this curiosity about art and how art advances the world and what&apos;s science&#8211;like collides with it, and something happens like the Futurists, the idea that the automobile could change the entire perspective of art. I was like huh, technology, science and art have always led to some kind of quantum leap. Photography, you know, the unholy art. Later, we love photographs, so technology always puts a little kind of an accident in the oyster, a little bit of sand gets in there and you wait a while and artists, people create the art that we all suddenly can&apos;t </br>live without.<a href="http://www.nea.gov/av/avCMS/Maeda-podcast-transcript.html"><sup>1</sup></a></blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>
I began to design stuff, like chopstick wrappers, napkins, menus&#8211;whatever I could get a handle on: sort of wheel&#8211;and&#8211;deal, move up in the design world, whatever.</q><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/john_maeda_on_design.html" target="_blank"><sup>8</sup></a>
				</p>
				<p>
The digital revolution or information age is a period of rapid growth in technology that we are living through. Everything seems to be in constant flux, a state that agrees with Maeda. I understand Maeda&apos;s engagement with the computer and the digital or information age as a process with three phases: adopt, react and adapt.
				</p>
				<p>
As a young man, Maeda wholeheartedly adopted the computer and code into his work. The early years of the computer were an age of experiment. The 1990s were a time of financial prosperity and economic growth in Japan and the US. Maeda found a mentor and wealthy supporter in Japanese publisher Enami Naomi who commissioned him to experiment with the digital form. Naomi believed in making a lot of money on commercial work and then spending it on doing things that you wanted to. He published Maeda&apos;s series of Reactive Books.

			</video>
				<p>
During this time, Maeda worked on a number of commercial projects for Shiseido, Gilbert Paper, Morisawa and Sony, among others. In the adopt phase, Maeda wholeheartedly embraced digital mediums.

				</figure>
				<p>
I define the next phase of Maeda&apos;s career as the react phase. The digital revolution brought along the ability to connect, even superficially with people around the globe. Uncensored, unfiltered information including loads of junk became available at out fingertips. According to Maeda the growing complexity in our world needs to be balanced with simplicity. In 2006 the MIT press published John Maeda&apos;s <span class="italic">The Laws of Simplicity</span> that offers ten laws for balancing simplicity and complexity in business, technology, and design including: reduce, organize, learn and trust. In the react phase Maeda begins to reinterpret digital media and question what it is. He uses mixed media and creates, for example, a physical robot that draws and a fish made of ipod nanos.

					<figcaption><span class="italic">Laws of Simplicity</span></figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
The third phase of Maeda&apos;s career is what I would characterize as the adapt phase. Maeda adapts what he does in response to the changing world. He is in the process of creating a new role for designers and for himself, that of leaders. He may be ahead of his time in making this move. This is Maeda&apos;s vision of the future: <blockquote>In 2112, creativity will be the most valued form of work because creativity is about going against what everyone  (including yourself)  believes in. By 2112, our minds will be directly connected to computers. We think having Google at our disposal has changed how we think about knowledge retention, but imagine when that knowledge is literally integrated into your being. We will all know all that we need to know, together, by being interconnected with all the information of the world. The answers won&apos;t be at our fingertips, they will be within us. And so goes any room for debate.
	What will be at a premium in this new world? What will enable us to retain our unique stamp of humanity? Our unique ability to create ideas and concepts that go against the all&#8211;powerful norm of the factual. The ways of thinking and working that artists and designers embody so naturally will be in higher demand. They are the ones who are used to flying in the face of reality, of suspending disbelief to come up with what is next. These skills will be universally recognized as how we advance society&apos;s future, rather than a nice <q>add&#8211;on</q> as they are perceived of today. Creativity will be the new currency of work, the world over.<a href="http://100.steelcase.com/mind/john-maeda/"target="_blank"><sup>22</sup></a></blockquote>

About his experience as a professor Maeda says: <blockquote>But two things left me wanting more. The first was my ongoing desire to be part of a winning team. As a professor you are a one&#8211;man show, a <q>one wolf</q> of sorts. And though I was always inspired by the work of my graduate students, I believed strongly in letting them pursue their own research paths rather than my own. I wanted to feel what it was like to go after a big goal with others.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second was an unshakable belief that art and design are poised to transform our economy in the 21st century like science and technology did in the last century. Innovation used to simply mean smaller, faster and cheaper technology, but I was seeing that that is no longer enough to compel consumers to buy, never mind solve societal problems. Access to ever&#8211;increasing data sets, complex scientific discovery, and always&#8211;on devices have left us oversaturated with information. It was in the face of this realization that I began work on The Laws of Simplicity and gave a related talk at the TED  (Technology, Entertainment, Design)  Conference. 
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly afterwards, I received a phone call from a headhunter about the possibility of leading a major art and design institution. I was happy to suggest names of other people the recruiter could contact instead of me, since I didn&apos;t see myself as presidential material at the time. I hadn&apos;t been a department head, dean, or provost at MIT, so I figured I should just <q>wait in line</q> as I&apos;d been told. But the conversations continued, and before I knew it I was the sixteenth president of the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD).<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/redesigning-leadership"target="_blank"><sup>23</sup></a></blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>
<q>It&apos;s arguably more important for the president of RISD to be familiar with manga and animation than to be able to quote Longfellow and the Transcendentalists of Concord because RISD is an unusual place, an incredible incubator of genius.</q><a href="http://www.rimonthly.com/Rhode-Island-Monthly/September-2008/John-Maeda-wants-to-jump-start-your-brain/index.php?cparticle=2&siarticle=1"target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a> Maeda fit the bill. Maeda joined RISD as president in 2008 and his contract has been renewed until 2015. RISD has <blockquote>been around for 131 years, since a group called the Centennial Women &#8212;formed to raise money for the Rhode Island exhibit at the 1876 Centennial Exposition &#8212;discovered that they had $1,676 left over after meeting expenses, and decided to use it as seed money to form the Rhode Island School of Design. A primary objective of this group, some of whom were the high-class wives of mill owners, was to teach artisans to apply <q>the principles of art to the requirements of trade and manufacture.</q><a href="http://www.rimonthly.com/Rhode-Island-Monthly/September-2008/John-Maeda-wants-to-jump-start-your-brain/index.php?cparticle=2&siarticle=1" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a>
</blockquote>				</p>
				<p>
RISD&apos;s <q>hottest graduate is currently Seth MacFarlane, creator of the animated series <q>Family Guy,</q> who recently signed a contract with Twentieth Century Fox TV for more than $100 million. Other graduates include famous musicians (Tina Weymouth and Chris Franz of the Talking Heads), film directors (Mary Lambert, Pet Sematary, Gus Van Sant, Good Will Hunting)  and artists in many mediums  (four of the twenty-five winners of MacArthur Fellowships, aka <q>genius grants,</q> named in 2006 were RISD alumni) .</q><a href="http://www.rimonthly.com/Rhode-Island-Monthly/September-2008/John-Maeda-wants-to-jump-start-your-brain/index.php?cparticle=2&siarticle=1" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a>

	<blockquote>Early in his tenure, Maeda said, he called 100 students who had been admitted to RISD just to get a sense for what they were thinking and expecting. One young woman spoke of how excited she was to win admission&#8212;she&apos;d dreamed of attending RISD from a young age&#8212;and how upset she was that she wouldn&apos;t be able to attend. Tuition, she said, was too expensive. That conversation, Maeda said, helped catalyze a major scholarship fundraising drive. And the school, Somerson said, has raised more for scholarships in the last three years than in its entire history combined.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somerson [RISD provost Rosanne Somerson] also spoke of a push to improve cross&#8211;disciplinary practice on campus. The school, for instance, is designing some pilot <q>shared making spaces</q> that might put a textile student next to a furniture student next to a glass student. Peer learning is already a big part of the RISD culture. This effort aims to exploit that tendency and create something new at the juncture of various disciplines.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RISD is also working to build its capacity as a research engine and to disseminate what it&apos;s learned. Many corporate and non&#8211;profit partners come to the school expecting RISD students and faculty to design the poster for their initiatives. But RISD aims for something more&#8212;what it calls <q>critical making.</q> Students attempt to formulate the questions that can guide a project. They look to rethink or redesign the system at its base.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A course called <q>Oystertecture,</q> part of a broader, multi&#8211;agency effort to examine the effects of climate change on coastal life, put students to work creating shellfish habitat in Rhode Island&apos;s waters.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maeda has also pushed RISD into the forefront of the <q>STEM to STEAM</q> movement. STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math&#8212;shorthand for a sprawling push to ramp up American education in these areas and put the country on better footing in the global economy. Art and design need a place in the acronym, Maeda argues. After all, the iPod was a triumph not just of technology, but of design. And he&apos;s getting some traction. Recently, he was on hand for the launch of a Congressional STEAM caucus in Washington.<a href="http://blog.thephoenix.com/BLOGS/notfornothing/archive/2013/02/25/risd-s-software.aspx" target="_blank"><sup>24</sup></a></blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>
Maeda&apos;s tenure at RISD has not been smooth. This excerpt from an interview shortly after Maeda was handed a vote of no&#8212;confidence in March 2011 summarizes the ups and downs of his first few years in office. <blockquote>One of [Maeda&apos;s] first goals&#8230;was to establish a more open form of leadership, in part by using digital tools to help spark conversation&#8230;Maeda immediately launched a president&apos;s blog. To encourage people to speak out, he instituted Anonymous Tuesdays on the site, where members of the RISD community could vent, as long as they refrained from personal attacks. He was a manic tweeter, delivering a stream of poetic aphorisms on leadership and creativity in 140 characters. And he was one of a tiny number of college presidents with a personal Facebook page.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a risky strategy, particularly at a school as fiercely analog as RISD. He was warned that it could backfire, but he was unconcerned.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years, one economic crisis, an endowment meltdown, and plenty of academic turmoil later, those words have come back to haunt him&#8230;On March 2nd, following the release of a new strategic plan designed around a more interdisciplinary framework for undergraduate studies, the RISD faculty voted <q>no confidence</q> in Maeda and provost Jesse Shefrin. The vote was 142&#8212;32. The chairman of the Faculty Meeting Steering Committee, Mark Sherman, said the administration <q>willfully ignored</q> the faculty&apos;s advice in reorganizing various academic divisions.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that no&#8212;confidence votes are a staple of academic politics&#8230;In response to the vote  (which represented just 36% of the faculty in the degree program) , the RISD board announced that it fully backed Maeda and Shefrin. Still, it was a stunning rebuke of their vision for the school&#8212;and of their ability to sell the plan to their stakeholders.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I spoke to Maeda a few days after the vote, he was concerned and humbled, but determined to soldier on. <q>I&apos;m not going to lose my job,</q> he says. <q>The issue now is how you move forward in a situation of impasse. It&apos;s a great question I&apos;m working through.</q>
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, his cyberstyle leadership was a misstep at a conservative campus battered by the recession. <q>He got off on the wrong foot in a superficial way,</q> says Kyna Leski, a RISD architecture professor. <q>The culture at RISD doesn&apos;t put much weight in fast tweets.</q> Still, Leski was disappointed in her colleagues&apos; judgment. <q>The faculty at RISD hasn&apos;t noticed that the world has changed over the past few years. Artists should have their eyes open to the world. John is exactly what RISD needed, and I&apos;m ashamed of my peers right now.</q>
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maeda acknowledges that he now understands that social media can only take you so far in redesigning leadership&#8230;<q>Now I talk about <q>when digital doesn&apos;t do it,</q>  he says&#8230;I realize that what I thought could work in the digital era doesn&apos;t have the same impact locally as it does globally. People don&apos;t want more messages; they want more interactions. There&apos;s no perfect memo where you can press send and get connected, or Facebook group you can join to be committed.</q>
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maeda has scaled back his blogging. He accepts that the big Samsung screens he installed as a way to bring students together digitally, by allowing them to post new work, notices of events, and messages, never caught on. <q>Technologists believe that if they impose a solution, people will adopt it,</q> he says. <q>But buy&#8212;in can&apos;t be bought.</q>
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, he says, he&apos;s going about leading in the old&#8212;fashioned way: building relationships one at a time, having coffee with faculty, jogging with students late at night, offering free pizza as an inducement to get them to show up and talk. These interactions are time&#8212;consuming, high&#8212;bandwidth, interactive, fiscally expensive for a busy president, and unscalable. He has continued to tweet, despite the fact that it annoys some RISD faculty, because he views Twitter as a public notebook, a way to learn out loud.<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1826824/how-john-maeda-sold-risds-faculty-his-vision-school" target="_blank"><sup>25</sup></a></blockquote> 
				</p>
				<p>
Maeda talks about a book he wrote that stemmed from his initial experiences at RISD. <blockquote> <span class="italic">Redesigning Leadership</span> is a book I wrote with Becky Bermont, and it was meant to take all those tweets, calling on some of them, and expanding on them. People&apos;s experience of being a leader comes in different frames; whether as someone who comes from education, someone who comes as a technologist, someone who comes as a creative person. These are the different faces of learning how to lead&#8230;it&apos;s just an expression of what it means to lead in these times&#8212;these very difficult times. And the hope was to have other people learn from what I&apos;ve learned, in that format.<a href="http://cn-tmp.artinfo.com/news/story/38732/playing-with-ideas-designer-and-risd-president-john-maeda-on-the-challenges-of-leading-creative-people"target="_blank"><sup>26</sup></a></blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>
	Maeda asks <q>What can we learn from artists and designers for how to lead? Because in many senses, a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes. Someone who&apos;s creative actually loves to learn from mistakes. A traditional leader is always wanting to be right, whereas a creative leader hopes to be right. And this frame is important today, in this complex, ambiguous space, and artists and designers have a lot to teach us.</q><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/john_maeda_how_art_technology_and_design_inform_creative_leaders.html"target="_blank"><sup>15</sup></a>

	Maeda is a fervent believer in critique. He takes constructive criticism to heart. He recalls another designer whispering in his ear that his (early) work was empty after Maeda presented it at a conference. Maeda could not help but agree with this man. Sure, the work bought him awards and acclaim, but he was not afraid to reevaluate it.
					</p>
					<p>
 	Maeda <q>felt something like guilt about helping to clutter up the Internet with too much <q>eye candy</q> and wrote as atonement a small book called <span class=italic>The Laws of Simplicity</span>, which argues for a less&#8211;is&#8211;more approach to design &#8212;at least to a point.</q><a href="http://www.rimonthly.com/Rhode-Island-Monthly/September-2008/John-Maeda-wants-to-jump-start-your-brain/index.php?cparticle=2&siarticle=1" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a>
 					</p>
					<p>
 Maeda describes it as: <blockquote>a very short, simple book. There are ten laws and three keys&#8230;So, if I simplify the laws of simplicity, I have what&apos;s called the cookie versus laundry thing. Anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid a big cookie or a small cookie, which cookie are they going to take? The big cookie. You can say the small cookie has Godiva chocolate bits in it, but it doesn&apos;t work. They want the big cookie. But if you offer kids two piles of laundry to fold, the small pile or the big pile, which will they choose? Strangely, not the big pile. So, I think it&apos;s as simple as this. You know, when you want more, it&apos;s because you want to enjoy it. When you want less, it&apos;s because it&apos;s about work. And so, to boil it all down, simplicity is about living life with more enjoyment and less pain.<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/john_maeda_on_the_simple_life.html" target="_blank"><sup>20</sup></a></blockquote>
